= Suggests ID plugin readme

Suggests an identifier/url chunk based on provided fields.

I use this plugin to generate login names, e-mail addresses and URLs for
user-entered content.

The plugin takes one or more strings as input, sanitizes the input and 
generates a list of possible IDs.  The shortest ID is returned.


== Installation
<tt>./script/plugin install http://code.dunae.ca/suggests_id</tt>


== Usage examples

In your model, specify which column holds the identifier - this is used when 
checking for duplicates.

  class User < ActiveRecord::Base
    suggests_id :target => :login_name
  end

Optionally, you can add an array of disposable words which will be trimmed out 
when generating IDs.

  class User < ActiveRecord::Base
    suggests_id :target => :login_name, :disposable => ['mr', 'mrs', 'ms', 'miss']
  end

Run your input through <tt>suggest_id</tt> to an ID suggestion.

 >> User.suggest_id('John Smith')
 => "johnsmith"

 # Disposable words are removed if possible
 >> User.suggest_id(['Mr.', 'John', 'Smith'])
 => "johnsmith"


== Testing

The unit tests for this plugin use an in-memory sqlite3 database (http://www.sqlite.org/).

To execute the unit tests run the default rake task (<tt>rake</tt>). To execute the unit 
tests but preserve to debug log run <tt>rake test</tt>.
